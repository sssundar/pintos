>> A2: What is the maximum size of a file supported by your inode
>> structure?  Show your work.

The last 4 bytes in our inode_disk struct point to a double indirect block.
That is, they encode the sector number of a block where each of the 512 / 4 = 
128 entries points to a single indirect block where each of ITS 128 entries 
is a direct mapped data block. That is, each single indirect pointer has 
scope over 128 * 512 = 64 KiB of data. There are 128 single indirect
pointers, so we get 128 * 64 KiB = 8 MiB of storage possible from one 
inode_disk.

By using exactly one double indirect block, zero single direct blocks,
and zero direct mapped blocks in the inode_disk struct, we get a maximum
file size of 8MiB as desired but keep the design as simple as possible.
No configuration involving some metadata and zero double indirect blocks 
can realize 8MiB file sizes, so our implementation is the simplest possible
one giving at least the required file size.

It is by no means the most efficient for anything but the largest file
sizes. Please see index_sizing.py - we know there were parametric ways
of approaching this problem, that would have let us experiment with
different branch-order choices.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A3: Explain how your code avoids a race if two processes attempt to
>> extend a file at the same time.

Files attempting to write to a file first check the inode length from disk.
They do this without any lock, so the number is not consistent between them,
necessarily, especially if someone else is just wrapping up an extension.

If they see grounds for extending the file, they attempt to get an extension
lock. One succeeds, checks the length again (this time sure it's the only
one who could change it) and decides if it actually needs to extend.

If it does, it proceeds to extend the file to exactly the length it desires,
not rounded up a block. The details of this operation are outside the scope
of this question. Then it writes whatever it wanted to write, and THEN, 
it updates the length. This way incoming writers and readers don't see any
open space (if they want to work past file boundaries) until this write
is complete. No "extension zeros" are readable.

It then releases the extension lock, and the other guy comes in and 
decides if he still needs to extend anything.

In this manner, readers (so long as they aren't reading beyond
the visible file boundaries) aren't blocked at all, and writers staying
within the confines of the file aren't either; only other extenders are blocked.

One or the other will access the length first. Suppose A does. A, being a
reader, will take the length as fixed. If A's read stays within the bounds
of this length, A assumes any extenders are done extending, and proceeds
without acquiring any locks. If A's read extends the current length, A 
reads zero bytes beyond it's initially observed length. That means,
no extension-zeros, no partial extension writes, it just stops at the
length it first saw.

B, on the other hand, will take a cursory look at the length,
and if its write will pass the length, it tries to acquire an extension
lock. Once this is received, B checks the length again, and if no one
else has extended past the point B wants to write, B holds the lock, and
extends the file (how is, again, beyond the scope of the queston). B does
NOT change the length of the file in the meantime. It just blocks any other
writers who want to extend the file (other writers and readers are fine, and
readers overreaching will just see the old length and stop reading). 

When B is done extending, it writes what it wants to write, then it changes
the length, and releases the extension lock. Now, any readers/writers who want
to extend are welcome to do so - they see all of what B intended to write. 

Therefore, A will read none or all of what B writes - never part.

We provide fair file access by using a custom read/write lock. Here are
its enumerated type and struct:

    /*! A read-write lock's mode. */
    enum rwmode { UNLOCKED, RLOCKED, WLOCKED, IOLOCKED };

    struct rwlock {                    
        enum rwmode mode;              
        uint32_t  num_waiting_readers;
        uint32_t num_waiting_writers;
        uint32_t num_waiting_ioers;    // Number of waiting evicters/flushers.
        uint32_t num_current_readers;
        struct lock lock;
        struct condition rcond;        // Condition variable for readers.
        struct condition wcond;        // Condition variable for writers.
        struct condition iocond;       // Condition var for evicters/flushers.
    };

We provide an initialization function and a pair of acquisition and release
functions, each of which takes two booleans. The first bool is true if a 
reader is trying to acquire or release the RW lock and false if it's a
writer. The second bool is true if an evicter or flusher is trying to
acquire or release the lock. It would be more appropriate to call this a
R/W/IO lock since it also protects dirty sectors in the cache. It would
probably have been better to separate the r/w lock, since it's a general
concept with existing implementations that we could in theory plug into
our codebase in the future, from the io lock. It would probably have also
been better to have rolled the two bools into an enum, but we're too 
time-limited to refactor the RW lock.

In any case the actual fairness is implemented like this. If the RW lock
is UNLOCKED then grant the lock to whomever asks for it by changing
to the corresponding mode. None of the num_waiting_* variables are
incremented because the asker gets instant access---it doesn't have to 
wait. If the lock is RLOCKED then grant access to readers instantly
and don't increment anything for the same reason, unless there are waiting
writers. In that case queue the reader behind the writers by incrementing the
number of waiting readers and waiting until a writer signals this reader. If 
it's RLOCKED but a writer asks for the lock then queue it behind the readers
by incremeneting the number of waiting writers and waiting for the *last* of
the non-waiting readers to signal it to go ahead. 

Now if the mode is WLOCKED and a reader asks for it then the reader must
wait until a writer signals him. Likewise if a writer asks for a WLOCKED
RW lock, since in our implementation any number of readers can simultaneously
use a sector but only one writer can. The IOLOCKED mode works analogously,
as does lock release intead of lock acquisition. The code is generously
commented if you want to take a look. Once again we acknowledge that there
is a much better way to do RW locking, but we discovered it late enough
that it didn't make sense to refactor.

TODO update this paragraph if this changes:

When Hamik was implementing subdirectories he wanted to keep the design
as simple as possible so debugging would be easier and so we'd have
subdirectories working even if file extension didn't work. He knew that
we had only one double indirect block referenced from the inode_disk struct 
and that there was a lot of empty space under the meta data and above
the pointer. He decided to use 100 * 4 contiguous bytes in the middle of
the struct for direct mapped block pointers---that is, of sector numbers.
This region is the 100-element dir_contents array below. We also store
the inode's filename---i.e., the part at the end of any path pointing to
the file---and a bool which is true if the inode is for a directory, false
otherwise. We kept the 14 character limit for filenames. Each inode_disk 
also keeps its parent directory's sector number.

    };

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: Describe your code for traversing a user-specified path. How
>> do traversals of absolute and relative paths differ?

The 'filename', 'parent_dir', and 'dir_contents' fields are the crucial 
elements in our path traversal algorithm. Consider an absolute path like
"/a/b/c". We detect that it's an absolute path by checking if the first
character is '/'; if it is then we start off a 'curr_dir_sector' variable
at 1, the sector number of the root directory's inode. Next we loop over
each '/'-delimited directory in the path, updating 'curr_dir_sector' at
each iteration. For instance, for the example absolute path we examine the
file 'a' in the first iteration under the 'current_dir_sect' 1. We open
the inode---using the cache---and examine each of the 100 inodes referenced 
in its 'dir_contents' array, skipping those that are set to the sentinel
value BOGUS_SECTOR. If the directory entry's inode has a 'filename' which
matches "a" then we update 'curr_dir_sector' to that inode's sector number
and continue. If we're examining a path like "/a/../b" then we'll have to
work with the file ".." in the second iteration; instead of examining the
directory contents of "a" for ".." we just get the sector number of the
parent of "a".

When we are finished with the path and leave the loop we store the enclosing
directory's inode in the 'parent' out-parameter, store the filename minus
any path-prefex in the 'filename' out-parameter, and return the file's 
inode. There some edge cases like "/directory_name/" to consider but we've 
captured the gist of our implementation. This algorithm is encapsulated in
the function with the header:

    struct inode *dir_get_inode_from_path(
            const char *path, struct inode **parent, char *filename);

We don't allow deletion of directories that are open by one or more processes.
The function 'filesys_remove' calls a function in thread.c called 

    bool thread_is_dir_deletable(const char *path)
    
which iterates over all files open by all processes and returns true if some 
process has the given directory open, if it's the current working directory of
some process, or if the directory is not empty.

>> B6: Explain why you chose to represent the current directory of a

Thread structs contain a 'cwd_sect' field which holds the sector number
of the current working directory of a process. Hamik initially implemented
the CWD as a statically allocated dir struct, each of which contains an 
inode struct pointer and a position, but he realized after reading this
question that if changes were made to the directory underling a process's
CWD then the process wouldn't see them! The inode struct pointer in a dir
struct points to an in-memory inode which isn't updated. None of the tests
caught this bug.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how your cache replacement algorithm chooses a cache
>> block to evict.

It is the simplest possible clock. It maintains a circular array-queue structure
with a head pointer, and cycles through once searching for non-accessed, non-
dirty, and not-in-the-process-of-being-evicted cache sectors. If it finds none,
it cycles again, and this time it takes anything that isn't being evicted,
the first it finds (whether accessed or dirty). We do not discriminate between
metadata and actual data.

>> C3: Describe your implementation of write-behind.

In the 'filesys_init' function we create a thread called "write-behind" which
runs in the function

    void write_behind_func(void *aux);
    
The timer from our thread project was buggy, so we implemented a crude timer
instead. Every time 'thread_schedule_tail' runs we increment 'total_ticks' 
and check if it divides into 'TICKS_UNTIL_WRITEBACK', which is currently
set to 512 ticks. Each "tick" corresponds to a thread switch. Every 512
ticks we up a semaphore called 'crude_time' which is extern'd in filesys.c
and on which 'write_behind_func' waits. Which is wakes up it calls the
function 'flush_cache_to_disk' to write all dirty cache sectors back to
disk.

>> C4: Describe your implementation of read-ahead.

In the 'filesys_init' function we create a thread called "write-behind" which
runs in the function

    void read_ahead_func(void *aux);
    
Every time we read in a new sector in cache.c's 'cache_read' we make sure the
next sector isn't already in the read-ahead queue or already in the cache. If
it isn't then we add it to the read-ahead queue, which is called 'ra_sectors'
and is extern'd from filesys.c and signal a condition variable called
'cond_ra'. 'read_ahead_func' was waiting on this condition variable, whose
corresponding condition is the non-emptiness of the 'ra_sectors' queue. After
it's signaled we dequeue a read-ahead sector and load it into the cache.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> C5: When one process is actively reading or writing data in a
>> buffer cache block, how are other processes prevented from evicting
>> that block?

We use a read/write/io condition lock. Reads and writes are in-memory accesses.
IO accesses are disk access (evictions, replacements). All mutually exclude
each other.

If one process is actively reading or writing in-memory (not replacement or
eviction), things are straightforward: the would-be evictors check for
a flag that other evictors know to leave, saying "don't try to evict me."
This flag is set atomically within a cache-sweep lock. If they don't see
the lock, they set the flag themselves, atomically, and try to acquire
an IO lock. 

They get priority if the current readers or writers finish. This means
not that there are no waiting readers/writers, but the current ones,
the ones inside the condition lock already, have to exit the lock, before
others are allowed R->IO, W->IO or R->W, W->R access.

By means of this flag, only one thread ever queues up for an IO lock, or holds 
it, max - there is never a running IO lock holder + an IO lock waiter.

>> C6: During the eviction of a block from the cache, how are other
>> processes prevented from attempting to access the block?

This is the tricky case, because I did it with a flag and a lock, rather than
a try_to_get_lock. So, I'm thinking I need to evict a block because I don't
see it in the cache array.

I acquire a cache sweep lock so the cache metadata is know static.
I search the cache for my sector of interest. If I do not find it, 
I use my clock eviction policy to pick an eviction candidate.

Now, I need to atomically flag the sector in question so that other evicters
know to leave it alone. I then release my cache sweep lock,
and request an IO lock. 

No others will try to evict this sector now. Readers and writers will
keep trying to access the sector for the OLD sector, still in there. Unknown
to me, others trying to bring in my sector of interest might succeed elsewhere.

Now I get the IO lock. I check to see (with a cache sweep lock) whether
my sector of interest is anywhere else. If it is, I release the IO lock
and reset the evicters-ignore flag, and walk out of the sector, to try to
go to that sector (if it still exists when I get there).

If my target still isn't anywhere else, then, still within the static confines 
of the sweep lock, I get a pending_io lock, then set the metadata for the 
cache sector to identify the old sector I'm about to evict, and the new
sector I'm about to bring in. 

Now threads already blocked on the old sector, when they wake up when I'm done,
will see that they have the wrong sector and go look somewhere else. New threads
coming in looking for the old sector know to block on me till I finish 
evicting (synchronizing to disk) so they won't attempt to bring the same
block in anywhere else. New threads coming in looking for the thing I'm 
bringing in won't be able to beat me to the punch (say they get to the 
old disk sector between the time it takes me to release the sweep lock
and get the IO lock). They'll block on the pending_io lock because they'll
see an eviction is in place so the "current disk sector" isn't ready yet.

Now I can release the sweep lock. The metadata changes show up atomically,
and the dual-locking mechanism ensures I can't be beaten to the sector
by others looking for the same target sector. Shortly after I get the
IO lock, I can release the pending_io lock. The waiting threads for the 
sector I'm bringing up all wake up, see they need my sector, and block
on the proper rwio lock. 

So now I can finish at my leisure. I evict, replace if necessary, or clear
if it's just a new sector being allocated, and then get a sweep lock,
remove the evicters ignore flag, reset accessed and dirty bits, and 
release my IO lock, followed by the sweep lock, so from the outside world's 
point of view the sector is atomically ready for rw/io again.

>> C7: Describe a file workload likely to benefit from buffer caching,
>> and workloads likely to benefit from read-ahead and write-behind.

When the "working group" of files open by all processes fits entirely into
the cache then we won't have to access the disk at all until the write-behind
thread runs for back-up. That scenario would benefit enormously from caching.

If we have a file larger than the cache that is accessed linearly from start 
to finish then read-ahead would help a lot. So long as not too many others
were also reading/writing with accesses requring the cache; in that case
read-ahead might toss a ton of metadata and slow us down. 

Write-back would help with data recovery and consistency under system crashes.

               SURVEY QUESTIONS
               ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the feedback survey on the course
website.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

Took a week of continual effort to get things partially working. Cutting
some things like read-ahead and write-behind would help with making the 
project more tractable for a two-week finals-week time frame.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave

Our familiarity with concurrency issues increases as does our appreciation
for the ubiquity of edge cases handled by real operating systems. One
set of experiences is more useful---though just as painful---as the other :-)

The write-up *did* say that RW locks were standard concepts, so we should
have realized that was a cue to look them up elsewhere... but we didn't 
and ended up spending about a day writing just the RW lock. Maybe explicitly
write something like "see Wikipedia for a RW lock article?" 

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students in future quarters?

Not really. We thought you handled this class super-well considering its size.
Hell, why waste institute money on teaching assistants? You got this! :-D

>> Any other comments?

None.
