None. I heard from Ajay and the twins that there was a good Wikipedia article
on read/write locks. Apparently their R/W lock is about forty lines. Ours is 
hilariously bloated compared to that. Guess we should have looked at Wikipedia!

             INDEXED AND EXTENSIBLE FILES
             ============================

The last 4 bytes in our inode_disk struct point to a double indirect block.
That is, they encode the sector number of a block where each of the 512 / 4 = 
128 entries points to a single indirect block where each of ITS 128 entries 
is a direct mapped data block. That is, each single indirect pointer has 
scope over 128 * 512 = 64 KiB of data. There are 128 single indirect
pointers, so we get 128 * 64 KiB = 8 MiB of storage possible from one 
inode_disk.

By using exactly one double indirect block, zero single direct blocks,
and zero direct mapped blocks in the inode_disk struct, we get a maximum
file size of 8MiB as desired but keep the design as simple as possible.
No configuration involving some metadata and zero double indirect blocks 
can realize 8MiB file sizes, so our implementation is the simplest possible
one giving at least the required file size.

We provide fair file access by using a custom read/write lock. Here are
its enumerated type and struct:

    /*! A read-write lock's mode. */
    enum rwmode { UNLOCKED, RLOCKED, WLOCKED, IOLOCKED };

    struct rwlock {                    
        enum rwmode mode;              
        uint32_t  num_waiting_readers;
        uint32_t num_waiting_writers;
        uint32_t num_waiting_ioers;    // Number of waiting evicters/flushers.
        uint32_t num_current_readers;
        struct lock lock;
        struct condition rcond;        // Condition variable for readers.
        struct condition wcond;        // Condition variable for writers.
        struct condition iocond;       // Condition var for evicters/flushers.
    };

We provide an initialization function and a pair of acquisition and release
functions, each of which takes two booleans. The first bool is true if a 
reader is trying to acquire or release the RW lock and false if it's a
writer. The second bool is true if an evicter or flusher is trying to
acquire or release the lock. It would be more appropriate to call this a
R/W/IO lock since it also protects dirty sectors in the cache. It would
probably have been better to separate the r/w lock, since it's a general
concept with existing implementations that we could in theory plug into
our codebase in the future, from the io lock. It would probably have also
been better to have rolled the two bools into an enum, but we're too 
time-limited to refactor the RW lock.

In any case the actual fairness is implemented like this. If the RW lock
is UNLOCKED then grant the lock to whomever asks for it by changing
to the corresponding mode. None of the num_waiting_* variables are
incremented because the asker gets instant access---it doesn't have to 
wait. If the lock is RLOCKED then grant access to readers instantly
and don't increment anything for the same reason, unless there are waiting
writers. In that case queue the reader behind the writers by incrementing the
number of waiting readers and waiting until a writer signals this reader. If 
it's RLOCKED but a writer asks for the lock then queue it behind the readers
by incremeneting the number of waiting writers and waiting for the *last* of
the non-waiting readers to signal it to go ahead. 

Now if the mode is WLOCKED and a reader asks for it then the reader must
wait until a writer signals him. Likewise if a writer asks for a WLOCKED
RW lock, since in our implementation any number of readers can simultaneously
use a sector but only one writer can. The IOLOCKED mode works analogously,
as does lock release intead of lock acquisition. The code is generously
commented if you want to take a look. Once again we acknowledge that there
is a much better way to do RW locking, but we discovered it late enough
that it didn't make sense to refactor.

TODO update this paragraph if this changes:

When Hamik was implementing subdirectories he wanted to keep the design
as simple as possible so debugging would be easier and so we'd have
subdirectories working even if file extension didn't work. He knew that
we had only one double indirect block referenced from the inode_disk struct 
and that there was a lot of empty space under the meta data and above
the pointer. He decided to use 100 * 4 contiguous bytes in the middle of
the struct for direct mapped block pointers---that is, of sector numbers.
This region is the 100-element dir_contents array below. We also store
the inode's filename---i.e., the part at the end of any path pointing to
the file---and a bool which is true if the inode is for a directory, false
otherwise. We kept the 14 character limit for filenames. Each inode_disk 
also keeps its parent directory's sector number. 

    /*! Temporary restriction on # of files possible in one directory entry
        so we can work on extensible files in parallel with subdirectories. */
    #define MAX_DIR_ENTRIES 100
    
    /*! Sentinel value for entries in directory contents array. See below. */
    #define BOGUS_SECTOR 0xFFFFFFFF
    
    /*! On-disk inode. Must be exactly BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE bytes long. */
    struct inode_disk {
        block_sector_t start;               /*!< First data sector. */
        off_t length;                       /*!< File size in bytes. */
        bool is_dir;                        /*!< True if is a directory. */
        char filename[NAME_MAX + 1];
    
        /*! Sector of parent dir. Only set to not BOGUS_SECTOR for dirs. */
        block_sector_t parent_dir;
    
        /*! Entries in this dir. Set to BOGUS_SECTOR if they are unused. */
        block_sector_t dir_contents[MAX_DIR_ENTRIES];
    
        unsigned magic;                     /*!< Magic number. */
        uint32_t unused[20];                /*!< Not used. */
    };

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: Describe your code for traversing a user-specified path. How
>> do traversals of absolute and relative paths differ?

The 'filename', 'parent_dir', and 'dir_contents' fields are the crucial 
elements in our path traversal algorithm. Consider an absolute path like
"/a/b/c". We detect that it's an absolute path by checking if the first
character is '/'; if it is then we start off a 'curr_dir_sector' variable
at 1, the sector number of the root directory's inode. Next we loop over
each '/'-delimited directory in the path, updating 'curr_dir_sector' at
each iteration. For instance, for the example absolute path we examine the
file 'a' in the first iteration under the 'current_dir_sect' 1. We open
the inode---using the cache---and examine each of the 100 inodes referenced 
in its 'dir_contents' array, skipping those that are set to the sentinel
value BOGUS_SECTOR. If the directory entry's inode has a 'filename' which
matches "a" then we update 'curr_dir_sector' to that inode's sector number
and continue. If we're examining a path like "/a/../b" then we'll have to
work with the file ".." in the second iteration; instead of examining the
directory contents of "a" for ".." we just get the sector number of the
parent of "a".

When we are finished with the path and leave the loop we store the enclosing
directory's inode in the 'parent' out-parameter, store the filename minus
any path-prefex in the 'filename' out-parameter, and return the file's 
inode. There some edge cases like "/directory_name/" to consider but we've 
captured the gist of our implementation. This algorithm is encapsulated in
the function with the header:

    struct inode *dir_get_inode_from_path(
            const char *path, struct inode **parent, char *filename);

We don't allow deletion of directories that are open by one or more processes.
The function filesys_remove calls a function in thread.c called 

    bool thread_is_dir_deletable(const char *path)
    
which iterates over all files open by all processes and returns true if some 
process has the given directory open, if it's the current working directory of
some process, or if the directory is not empty.
